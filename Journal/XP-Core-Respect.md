# XP Core Values - Respect - Mohana Gudur Valmiki

## Week 1

-	In this week, we have first met and introduced ourselves in a team. Although compared to most organizations which 
	adopt XP core values, we are a relatively small team and this team consists of only developers; we still value and 
	respect each other's ideas, input, and passion for the project. We have shared our opinions in the group chat, and 
	discussed over each other's ideas of implementation. We respected everyone's idea during a meeting, and voted on 
	the most feasible implementation idea. Every person in the team was happy about the decision, and felt respected 
	during the process.


## Week 2

-	We sat together this week and divided the work to each member. We have discussed multiple times what features / user 
	stories we could implement. In this planning process, we had a lot of different ideas and also had disagreements. When 
	we had different opinions, we took turns to explain ourselves and paid attention to the others' reasoning. We have 
	raised questions respectfully and resolved the disagreements through explaining to each other. When we divided the 
	tasks, the team members respected each other's interest and choices.

## Week 3

-	We have started the code implementation this week. We divided our work and developed APIâ€™s individually. The way we kept
	the XP core value of respect was to communicate and update our progress through group chat and slack stand-up meetings.
	When any team member has shown progress or any updates of the project, the rest of the team would respectfully look at 
	the progress or updates, and give him or her positive feedbacks. We not only gave each other constructive suggestions or
	advice, but also told each other "good job" and appreciated the efforts.


## Week 4

-	This week is the last week of the project. We have tested the code functionality and finalized the project. We sat 
	together for a retrospective meeting. During the meeting, we reflected on our project and also checked together to make 
	sure we have accomplished all the tasks. For wrapping up some of the tasks, we had a discussion and divided the works. 
	Shivani took the responsibility of noting the final tasks down and sending in a group chat. The rest of the team 
	appreciated her effort and were happy to accomplish the tasks, because our interest and passion were respected.
