# XP Core Values - Simplicity - Shivani Suryawanshi

## Week 1

-	The value of simplicity helped us during our planning phase. I was assigned to keep the XP core value simplicity, so I thought it would be necessary for us to revisit the requirements listed for this group project. Considering the simplicity value and the time limit, I suggested that we shall put our attention fully on what we were required to do, nothing more and nothing less. Therefore, we have made the final decision of designing online banking system as per the requirements provided in the team project document.

## Week 2

-	During the planning stage, I have discovered some complex parts in the design. Meanwhile we also had many ideas of implementing the design. However, after discussion, we decided to keep our progress simple, one step at a time, to avoid possible failures. We decided to first implement the API’s that can be used by other API’s to ensure the consistency and stability.

## Week 3

-	This week all of us have started implementing the user stories, and some of us have already started working on the second user story. Although we have more than one tasks to accomplish, we still keep a fixed number of tasks to work on in order to achieve simplicity. For example, in my case, I have finalized the implementation of account creation and money transfer API. Instead of rushing to implementing the second task that I have been assigned by the group, I made sure my codes for the first task were fully functional and did not create bugs when integrating with others' parts. After testing, debugging, and integration, I could finally move on to the next task. Doing one thing at a time was helpful for the group to keep the simplicity value. We have benefitted from this coding habit and did not encounter major failures.

## Week 4

-	In this week, we have mostly been working on wrapping up the project and checking for anything that has been left behind. This has been a four-week project and we are supposed to submit miscellaneous documents, files, etc. It was first hard to start, but later we decided to review the project requirements and to divide the checking and wrapping-up tasks to each member. Everyone had to make sure that his or her assigned part was properly done and ready to submit, so we as a whole group could have a complete and functional submission. We could not achieve this if we had not kept the simplicity value. It helped us to collaborate efficiently and to avoid failures.
