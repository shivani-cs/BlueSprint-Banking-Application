# XP Core Values - Feedback - Shivani Suryawanshi, Dhruvil Parikh, Mohana Gudur Valmiki

## Week 1

-	In our very first week, we have maintained a good habit of giving each other feedbacks. During our meeting, we have proposed different design frameworks and technologies, and how we could implement it ideally. After each person has finished the proposal, the other group members did not refuse the proposal directly, but we gave each other feedbacks and suggestions.

## Week 2

- This week, everyone came up with an approach for implementing their tasks. We talked about this with group members. Some ideas received positive feedbacks. However, sometimes group members gave a feedback saying it is not suitable approach and suggested some different approaches. Every team member listened carefully to their feedback and finalized the appropriate approach. 

## Week 3
- We mostly worked on our own to finish our assigned tasks. But this did not stop us from keeping the XP core value of feedback. For example, Dhruvil showed us his implementation of transaction API in the group chat, and we gave him feedbacks in the chat as well. Other team members have also done the same thing. We all found each other's feedback very helpful as every person has a different perspective. We listened to each other's feedbacks carefully, then think and act on them.

## Week 4

-	This week mostly we were wrapping up the project and preparing for submission. We could not take feedbacks on the code implementation, because we would not have time to add extra user stories at this point. How we kept the feedback value was through the process of preparing for the demonstration. We gave each other many inputs such as the length, contents, the beginning, effects of the demo. Everyone has taken feedbacks seriously and improved their content.
