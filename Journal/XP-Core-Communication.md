# XP Core Values - Communication - Dhruvil Parikh

## Week 1

-	In the first week, all of us met and introduced ourselves. We had a face-to-face communication on what technologies and framework has to be chosen for project, each of us have interacted well to come up with a framework and technologies for final project.

-	We met very often to make sure that everyone is on same page.

-	Created a Dailybot for regular communication and scrum model at 4 P.M every day to ensure that everyone communicates and brings out if there are any blockers.

-	Communication here helped us to evaluate each other’s ideas.

## Week 2

-	In the 2nd week, we have divided API’s among us after having a meeting on what everyone wants to take.

-	Each of us explained their approach to others to get a foresight of any possible flaw in the implementation.

-	Communication with other team mates on our approach and analysis has helped us to find the corner cases pointed by people in meeting and final design was made after the entire team's approval.

-	On a regular basis, we communicated on issues in merge and potential bugs which has helped us resolve them faster.

## Week 3

-	In the 3rd week, we have started implementing API’s individually and given demos of our API.

-	We seek each other help for integrating code.

-	We tracked the progress of our project and current state often to make sure we finish the project in anticipated time before deadline.

-	Took the peer reviews for implemented code and discussed with them to fix the review comments.

-	Communication between us have made us come up with optimized and cleaner code for relevant use-cases.

## Week 4

-	This week we have placed all our code in place and integrated it by sitting together and taking inputs on conflicts to make sure that we don't break any functionality.
