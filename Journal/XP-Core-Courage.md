# XP Core Values - Courage - Mohana Gudur Valmiki

## Week 1

-	During the first week, we have kept the courage value very well. This team project was a coding marathon that's 
	four-week long, and it seemed very intimidating at first. We were uncertain about how are we going choose to do 
	the project, but meeting with the group was definitely helpful for making us believe in ourselves and to be more 
	courageous. After the heated debates in the group chat and several face-to-face meetings, we realized we could 
	achieve a lot as a group and became fearless.

## Week 2

-	When we were planning and assigning tasks, we had kept the courage value. We would not lie about our ideas or 
	our abilities, and we had the enough courage to let each other know our candid thoughts. Although when we 
	discussed the scope of project, one group member was afraid that implementing all the API’s would be difficult 
	because we were only 3 members in a group. Keeping the courage value was very helpful for our group, because 
	if we had not had the courage to implement all the API’s then we would not have known our true potential.

## Week 3

-	When we were coding, we always had to face unforeseeable consequences. The implementation phase was very 
	challenging because we were also taking other coding classes and had multiple responsibilities. During this 
	stage, sometimes one of us would have to dedicate more time on another subject, or sometimes one would encounter
	a bug that was a headache to resolve. Despite the difficulties, we never hid our progress from each other. 
	We had the courage to admit the challenges, to ask for help and understanding in the group, and to step forward 
	together.


## Week 4

-	Having gone through the hardest phases in our project, we could almost see the completion of the project. This made 
	us realized how important it was to keep the XP core value of courage. If we had not stood together and faced the 
	problems together, we could not have achieved what we have done in this project. The group members gave each other 
	support and courage to keep going. We have all gone through different situations and hardships throughout this project,
	but we were able to overcome them as a group because we have kept the courage value.
